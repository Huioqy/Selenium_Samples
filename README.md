Selenium 3.141.0


Installing
==========

pip install -U selenium



Drivers
=======

Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. 

Firefox, for example, requires `geckodriver <https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases>`_, which needs to be installed before the below examples can be run. Make sure it's in your `PATH`, e. g., place it in `/usr/bin` or `/usr/local/bin`.

Failure to observe this step will give you an error `selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: 'geckodriver' executable needs to be in PATH.`

Other supported browsers will have their own drivers available. Links to some of the more popular browser drivers follow.
